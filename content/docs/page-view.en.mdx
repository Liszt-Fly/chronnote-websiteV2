In Chronnote, you live in two worlds:  
one is the **Atom Library**, where all your raw materials live;  
the other is **Page View**, the place where you assemble those atoms into a real structure of thinking.

The Atom Library is like an infinite warehouse that can hold all your PDFs, notes, whiteboards and tasks.  
But if everything just lies there flat, they are only **loose pieces of data**.  
When you want to build a complex knowledge system—or let Chron Engine truly understand you—you need something stronger: **Page View**.

## 1. Mindset shift: not “folders”, but “nested atoms”

At first glance, Page View may remind you of a traditional “folders → files” hierarchy.  
That mental model is actually misleading.

- Traditional folders: a **rigid container** used only for classification.  
  The folder itself carries no content, just a name.
- Chronnote Page View: **atoms containing atoms**.  
  Every atom can become the “parent node” of other atoms.

The design is similar to nested pages in Notion, but Chronnote goes further:  
we support **all atom types** as parents and children—notes, PDFs, whiteboards, todos, mind maps and more.

Most importantly, these parent–child relationships carry strong **semantics**.

Some examples:

- When you drag a note under a PDF, you are telling the system:  
  > This note is an annotation about this PDF.
- When you drag a PDF under a to-do item, you are saying:  
  > This PDF is the reference material for completing this task.

In Page View, every time you “nest one atom under another”, you are effectively adding a **semantic edge** between them.  
You are not just tidying up folders—you are defining how pieces of knowledge relate to each other.

## 2. Why structure matters so much for Chron Engine

You might ask: “As long as I can search, isn’t that enough?”

In the AI era, **structure is context**.  
Chron Engine—the heart of Chronnote—doesn’t just retrieve your content, it also reads your **structure**.

When you carefully build a tree in Page View, you are effectively drawing a **knowledge map** for the AI.

- Sharper understanding
  - If Chron Engine only sees a **standalone note**, it can only guess based on the literal text.
  - If it sees that this note sits under a mind map → under a whiteboard → under a project,  
    it immediately understands:  
    this is a concrete conclusion derived inside a larger thinking framework.

- Natural contextual linking
  - When you ask a question, Chron Engine can follow the tree **upwards and downwards**:  
    parents become the **background** (context), children become the **details**.
  - With this, answers are no longer stitched from random snippets; they are grounded in the structure you created.

Put simply: **the clearer your structure, the more Chron Engine behaves like a collaborator who understands your project, not a generic chatbot.**

## 3. Practical example: a simple “study room makeover”

Imagine you want to turn a small room into a comfortable workspace.  
Your Atom Library might already contain:

- Screenshots and inspiration images  
- A PDF manual for your standing desk  
- A shopping list  
- A few to-do items

In Chronnote, you can use Page View to assemble these atoms into a semantic system.

### 3.1 A possible page structure

For example:

- Note: My 2024 study room makeover (root – project overview)
  - Whiteboard: Room layout sketch (child – space planning)
    - Note: Power outlet is on the left wall, desk must be placed on the left (grandchild – constraints)
  - PDF: Standing desk assembly manual (child – reference document)
    - Todo: Buy a Phillips screwdriver from the hardware store (grandchild – derived action)
  - Todo list: Double 11 shopping list (child – purchase plan)
    - Link: Ergonomic chair review video (grandchild – decision evidence)

Looked at individually, these atoms are “just files”.  
Once you nest them like this, they form a clear **Goal → Constraints → Execution** chain.

### 3.2 What Chron Engine understands from this

Once the structure is in place, Chron Engine reads not only the content, but also the **relationships**.

1. It can infer “why” (causal links)

You ask: “Why do I need to buy a screwdriver?”

- The engine sees the todo “buy screwdriver” hanging under the PDF “standing desk manual”.
- It can answer:  
  > Because you need it to assemble that standing desk.

2. It can understand “spatial logic”

You ask: “Why must the desk be placed on the left side?”

- The engine sees the note about the power outlet nested under the whiteboard layout.
- It can respond:  
  > According to your layout sketch, the power outlet is on the left wall, so the desk needs to go on the left.

3. It can see your “decision evidence”

You ask: “Why did I pick this chair?”

- The engine finds that, under your shopping list, there is a link to a specific review video.
- It knows this video is the **reason** you added the chair, and can summarise its key points instead of answering in a vacuum.

## Summary

In Chronnote’s Page View, every drag-and-drop nesting operation is a tiny act of **semantic modeling**.

- You are not just building a prettier tree view—you are building a **thinking model that AI can read**.
- The clearer the structure:
  - the **faster** Chron Engine can locate the right branch when searching, and  
  - the **deeper** it can reason about your goals, constraints and decisions.

So the next time you open a project, don’t just dump atoms into the library.  
Drag them into Page View, nest a few layers, and let your knowledge start forming **real relationships**.  
From that moment on, Chronnote stops being just a note-taking app—and starts acting as a partner that thinks with you.
